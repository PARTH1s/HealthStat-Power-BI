# HealthStat-Power-BI

# Project Overview

    HealthStat, a fictitious consulting company, hired us to analyze an anonymized dataset from hospitals in New York state. The goal is to uncover insights on potential hospital efficiency         
    opportunities for patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery. We utilized Power BI to create an engaging dashboard to visualize and present our findings.

# Dataset Details
    Data Source: New York state-wide hospital discharge data for the year 2016
    Patient Population: Those with "Elective hip replacement surgery"

# Key Attributes of Interest
    length_of_stay: Length of stay for patients.
    total_costs: Total costs associated with each inpatient stay.

# Data Analysis
    Initial Exploration
    Number of Hospitals: 151
    Total Discharges: 26,286
    Average Length of Stay (LOS): 2.65 days
   
# Calculated DAX Measures

# Insights Explored

    Identifying Outliers: We determined which hospitals had the highest costs and LOS relative to the state average.
    Overall Outliers: We identified hospitals that stood out as the biggest outliers in terms of cost and LOS.
    Impact of Surgical Program Size: We investigated whether the size of the surgical program in a hospital affected LOS and cost.
    Root Cause Analysis: We delved into factors that influenced LOS and cost the most.

# Key Findings
  
Average cost per discharge was $20,910.
Top influencers increasing average LOS and cost included extreme illness severity, major mortality risk, hospitals in New York City, and patient disposition to skilled nursing homes.
