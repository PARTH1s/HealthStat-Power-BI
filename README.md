# HealthStat-Power-BI


Healthstat | Healthcare Analytics
In this healthcare analytics case study, we analyzed New York state hospital data for elective hip replacement surgeries in 2016 using Power BI. We identified key insights, such as the average cost per discharge and factors influencing length of stay and cost. Our interactive Power BI dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore these findings visually, aiding HealthStat in identifying hospitals with potential efficiency improvements. Notable influencers on costs and length of stay included illness severity, mortality risk, location (New York City), and patient disposition to skilled nursing homes. This analysis equips HealthStat with valuable information for informed decision-making and improved patient care.

Project Overview
HealthStat, a fictitious consulting company, hired us to analyze an anonymized dataset from hospitals in New York state. The goal is to uncover insights on potential hospital efficiency opportunities for patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery. We utilized Power BI to create an engaging dashboard to visualize and present our findings.

Insights Explored
Identifying Outliers: We determined which hospitals had the highest costs and LOS relative to the state average.
Overall Outliers: We identified hospitals that stood out as the biggest outliers in terms of cost and LOS.
Impact of Surgical Program Size: We investigated whether the size of the surgical program in a hospital affected LOS and cost.
Root Cause Analysis: We delved into factors that influenced LOS and cost the most.
Key Findings
Average cost per discharge was $20,910.
Top influencers increasing average LOS and cost included extreme illness severity, major mortality risk, hospitals in New York City, and patient disposition to skilled nursing homes.
